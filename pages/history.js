				In this event, players receive four messages by other players
				and one from the bot, and must determine which one was generated
				by the bot. The third iteration of the Sneknet collects results
				from each round to determine which of the five messages was
				generated by the bot. With enough data, the correct answer can
				automatically be selected. correct answer is known.

			<Event icon={faVideo} name="RPAN" time="August 2019">
				RPAN is a streaming event with a cap on streamers and length.
				The Snakeroom used a script that sniped slots and allowed users
				to broadcast from an OBS stream, bypassing the intended
				limitation of streaming from a mobile device and allowing
				Snakeroom members to create <b>Place Live</b> and{" "}
				<b>RPAN Plays Pok√©mon</b>. They were also able to stream prior
				to the event going live, although Reddit admins quickly shut
				this down.

			<Event icon={faRandom} name="Sequence" time="April 2019">
				During this event, players were able to upload and vote on GIFs,
				with the highest-upvoted GIFs selected to become part of the
				final video. The second iteration of the Sneknet locks in select
				GIFs using the power of Snakeroom participants, without chancing
				success on the whims of the wider Reddit community.

				During this event, each player could create a single circle with
				a passcode of their choice. Players could share their passcode
				with orders so that their circle could gain more members, but
				doing so allows further spread of the passcode and the ability
				for players to betray the circle, ending it. The first iteration
				of the Sneknet makes players join a circle from a command sent
				on the backend and adds anyone running the extension before it
				can be betrayed.

				In the leadup to Circle of Trust, the community founds the
				Snakeroom Alliance after discovering the subreddit
				r/snakeroomtest, with many believing it to be part of the event.
				Eventually, the name is shortened to simply The Snakeroom and a
				development team forms to interact with the upcoming event.
